# Credit_Risk_Analysis
We'll use Python to build and evaluate several Machine Learning models to predict credit risk. Being able to predict credit risk with machine learning algorithms can help banks and financial institutions predict anomalies, reduce risk cases, monitor portfolios, and provide recommendations on what to do in cases of fraud.

## Overview of Project

Fast Lending, a peer-to-peer lending services company wants to use machine learning to predict credit risk. Management believes that this will provide a quicker and more reliable loan experience. It also believes that machine learning will lead to more accurate identification of good candidates for loans which will lead to lower default rates. We will build and evaluate several machine learning models or algorithms to predict credit risk. We'll use techniques such as re-sampling and boosting to make the most of our models and our data. Once we've designed and implemented these algorithms, we'll evaluate their performance and see how well your models predict data. To accomplish our task, we will dive headlong into machine learning algorithms, statistics, and data processing techniques.

In this project, we'll use Python and the Scikit-learn library to build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk. 
We'll work with new skills such as resampling, but we'll also build on old skills like data munching. 

We will apply machine learning to solve a real-world challenge: credit card risk

Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, we’ll oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, we’ll use a combinatorial approach of over-and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, we’ll compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk. Once we’re done, we’ll evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

Follow below the goals for this project:

1) Objective 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
2) Objective 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
3) Objective 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
4) Objective 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
